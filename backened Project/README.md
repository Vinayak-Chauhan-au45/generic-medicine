Generic Medicine
A generic drug is a pharmaceutical drug that contains the same chemical substance as a drug that
 was originally protected by chemical patents. Generic drugs are allowed for sale after the patents 
on the original drugs expire. Because the active chemical substance is the same, the medical profile
 of generics is equivalent in performance. A generic drug has the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) 
as the original, but it may differ in some characteristics such as 
the manufacturing process, formulation, excipients, color, taste, and packaging.
